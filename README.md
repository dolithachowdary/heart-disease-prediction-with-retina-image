# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Retinal Images

This project uses deep learning to predict the risk of heart disease by analyzing retinal fundus images. The objective is to develop a non-invasive, AI-based solution to assist in early diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions.

---

## 📌 Features

- Predicts heart disease risk from retinal images
- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Trained on medical image datasets
- Image preprocessing, training, and prediction pipeline included

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / VSCode

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

Use public datasets like:

- MESSIDOR (Retinal fundus images)
- Kaggle Heart Disease datasets (for labels)
- Custom dataset combining retinal images with cardiovascular risk scores

> Ensure proper handling of medical data and licenses.
